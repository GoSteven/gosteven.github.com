Worked on a simple repo recently, which is a diary site using Django-nonreal wich can use google app engine authentication. 

GitHub: [https://github.com/GoSteven/Diary](https://github.com/GoSteven/Diary)

Django-nonreal contain all the major functionalities of Django which can host pure Django application on google application. It just works awesome!
